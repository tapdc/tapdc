		<h2>What is TAP Edge?</h2>
		<p>
			In 2014, the Taiwanese American Professionals of Washington, D.C. (TAP-DC) launched its first ever mentor program, TAP Edge. Meant specifically to bridge the DMV Taiwanese/Taiwanese-American community, Edge pairs local undergraduate students with successful professionals for one-on-one career, academic, and life guidance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whether itâ€™s meeting up for a mock-interview or going out for some delicious Taiwanese treats, pair, pod, and program events are designed to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Build the Taiwanese/Taiwanese-American community through creating meaningful and lasting relationships</li>
			<li>Maximize professional resources within the network to enable more job opportunities</li>
			<li>Develop greater awareness of a shared Taiwanese heritage and culture</li>
			<li>Engage with DMV communities through community service at food banks, soup kitchens and local gardens</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>What is the professional development program?</h2>
		<p>
			The TAP-DC professional development committee hosts a number of events throughout the year focused on connecting and developing young professionals in the Washington, D.C. metro area. In addition, the professional development committee hosts a professional development day for undergraduates in the DC area to help prepare for their transition from college student to young professional. Our professional development committee also works with other professional groups in the area such as <a href="http://www.naaapdc.org/">NAAAP</a> and <a href="http://www.capal.org/">CAPAL</a>.
