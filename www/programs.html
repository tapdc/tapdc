		<h2>What is TAP Edge?</h2>
		<p>
			In 2014, the Taiwanese American Professionals of Washington, D.C. (TAP-DC) launched its first ever mentor program, TAP Edge. Meant specifically to bridge the DMV Taiwanese/Taiwanese-American community, Edge pairs local undergraduate students with successful professionals for one-on-one career, academic, and life guidance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whether itâ€™s meeting up for a mock-interview or going out for some delicious Taiwanese treats, pair, pod, and program events are designed to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Build the Taiwanese/Taiwanese-American community through creating meaningful and lasting relationships</li>
			<li>Maximize professional resources within the network to enable more job opportunities</li>
			<li>Develop greater awareness of a shared Taiwanese heritage and culture</li>
			<li>Engage with DMV communities through community service at food banks, soup kitchens and local gardens</li>
		</ul>
	
		<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
		<p>
			We recruit mentors and mentees biannually.
			Email Ariel at <a data-mail="YXJpZWwuY2hhb0B0YXAtZGMub3Jn"></a> for more info.

		<h2>Upcoming Edge event:</h3>
		<p>
			The TAP-Edge Mentor Program is looking for volunteers for its annual professional development half-day conference in April 2017.  
			Are you interested in giving back to the undergraduate student community?
			Do you have some true, tried, and tested pieces of advice and words of wisdom to relay back to the younger generation?
			Were there moments in your career--twists and turns, uncertainty, unexpected change in direction--in which you'd like to share? 
			If one or all of the above resonated with you, you may just be who we are looking for!
